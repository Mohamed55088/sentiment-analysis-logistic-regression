echo "# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The model is trained to classify reviews as positive or negative. The script includes advanced text preprocessing techniques such as handling negations and lemmatization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: HTML tag removal, lowercasing, special character removal, handling negations, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **Model Training**: Uses a pipeline with \`TfidfVectorizer\` and \`Logistic Regression\`.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes \`GridSearchCV\` for finding the best parameters.
- **Interactive Review Classification**: Allows users to input their own reviews and get real-time sentiment classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- re

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mohamed55088/sentiment-analysis-logistic-regression.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-logistic-regression
    \`\`\`

2. **Install Dependencies**
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
    \`\`\`

3. **Download NLTK Data**
    \`\`\`python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    \`\`\`

4. **Download the Dataset**
    - The script uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
    - Place the \`IMDB Dataset.csv\` file in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**
    \`\`\`bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    \`\`\`

2. **Classify Reviews Interactively**
    - After running the script, you can input your own reviews to get real-time sentiment classification.

## Script Breakdown

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
    \`\`\`python
    df = pd.read_csv('IMDB Dataset.csv')
    \`\`\`

- **Advanced Text Preprocessing**
    \`\`\`python
    def preprocess_text(text):
        # Lowercase, remove HTML tags, special characters, handle negations, tokenize, lemmatize
    \`\`\`

- **Model Training with Pipeline**
    \`\`\`python
    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()),
        ('clf', LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'))
    ])
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, parameters, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1)
    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    \`\`\`

- **Interactive Classification Loop**
    \`\`\`python
    while True:
        new_review = input('Write your review: ')
        print(f'Review: "{new_review}" is {classify_review(new_review)}')
    \`\`\`

## Example

\`\`\`plaintext
Write your review: I don't love this movie.
Review: "I don't love this movie." is negative
\`\`\`
